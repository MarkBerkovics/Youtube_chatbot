       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'vetLEg83xEA'}, page_content=\"anything in life can be medicine or poison right and so instead of just making anger poison how do you make it medicine and the way that you relate to it in the way that you experience it and ultimately you know one of the things that healed me was being able to have an anger gasm like literally being able to orgasm with the energy of my anger it so revolutionized my relationship to this emotion yes absolutely the first time I had a shame gasm was one of the most spiritual experiences I've I've ever had yeah you know it was like whoa this is shame yeah like this is my shame yeah you know and and to me it changed everything once we've worked on the charge around that past stuff we still need to meet these emotions inside oursel as a human being and that presence piece is is so incredibly key feeling that sense of Honor in being able to feel this in the here and now it just makes it so much more digestible I think in that way well what would a small emotional Liberation approach look like in that moment I think that's such a great question uh I'm Leila Martin I'm your host of this tantric life this podcast is for you to learn about and be able to use the incredibly powerful system of Tantra in your life I have been teaching and studying classical and neotantra for over 20 years and when you apply that to sex love and relationships as I love love to do you end up having conscious relationships the deepest most epic and magical sex and the kind of intimacy that you get to be grateful for on your deathbed hi and welcome to this tantric life I'm your host Leila Martin and today I am joined by one of my Vita coaching certification teachers Corey Scott so formally she's a licensed clinical social worker aemd I a certified eye movement desensitization reprocessing therapist say that several times fast a licensed yoga teacher and a Vita sex love and relationship coach as a trauma

from her own journey of deep trauma healing and personal transformation to learn more about her work and to connect with her you can visit her website www.c cornelias scott.com one of the reasons I'm so excited to share this conversation with Corey today is that she has developed a very unique and Powerful perspective on trauma healing that I believe can help you immensely in integrating and healing sexual trauma and past pain in your own life and body this comes from her unique perspective of being a trained psychotherapist and then working in sexual and emotional Liberation and in the fields of Tantra so Corey can you share with us this take on trauma healing that you have developed through your professional work and then I'd love as well if you can take us through a few moments of your own Journey that brought you to this awareness and to this work that you do yes absolutely Leila uh I think for me the perspective on trauma healing that has really transformed formed over time is is an idea that stabilization if that is our goal right to feel okay to feel normal that's often when people are coming to therapy or trauma treatment with you know unresolved amounts of trauma they have this sense of feeling out of control right you know I just want to feel normal I just want to feel okay and for me personally while that was an incredibly profound part of my Journey it never really clicked for me until I realized that the journey is so much more than just okay than just you know stabilization that truly as we begin to uncover our trauma and work with it and engage with it and even trust it in and of itself know that's kind of an edgy thing to say that we begin to find our true power our true like passions in life and this portal to Liberation that's really kind of where I am right now in my work I have a few questions for you on that then we can keep going so when someone has a lot of trauma what does it feel like in the body first of all because you said when someone comes in right and they're feeling a little bit like X Y and Z what are some of those feeling states that someone can be going through yeah I mean I think the most common is like there's something wrong with me you know I just can't get it right I'm not good enough all that unworthiness and shame that's a huge part of trauma in the attachment system right shame is the innate human response to the threat of disconnection and I think it's really to me that's the piece that's underlying even all the shock trauma which might come with a feeling of Terror you know like I just don't know the next moment when the shoe might drop kind of always on edge feeling you know internally chaotic yeah um whether that's coming out in angry outbursts or panic attacks or just feeling totally shut down and Frozen I think across the board for many trauma survivors that underlying theme of yeah there's something wrong with me I must be broken you know I'm just not good enough why can't I get it together we have this experience of you know kind of sitting in our own nervous system looking out at the world and comparing with all these people who seem to just get it be able to play by the rules and and play the game and yet we're stuck that stuck feeling is that nervous system freeze feeling disconnected from the flow of life um and I think that just creates so much of that self-blame and shame that's often a part of it yeah yeah I'm here to let you know that if you want to stay connected to my teachings and if you want to support this podcast the best way to do it is to sign up for my email list email list sounds old school and yet it is where I share my most intimate teachings the path process heartbreak and Triumph of my life and so much of the content that I make for you

the highest teachings of this path so i' love and then we'll get into your personal story if you could walk me through what stabilization could look like or would look like just so people understand the kind of framework we're starting from yeah I'll actually use some examples of my own trauma behaviors right so um I had a lot of complex PTSD and sexual abuse from my biological father so I intimately understand what what a traumatized nervous system feels like and a couple of the behaviors that were very notable to me some which I've integrated and rarely show up anymore some of which are more present in my life right now were um I used to have like pretty angry outbursts or like lashing out at people I loved uh tearing into people that I cared about like eviscerating them you know because I was so angry that one I did a ton of work on because I was like that's not okay and that's so destructive to people yeah and what was really painful about that was I loved those people so much you know and the more I know about myself and have gone into myself The more I've realized like what a soft loving caring human I am right and if you traumatize anyone enough right and they feel unsafe enough they will resort to that level of attack or that level of anger in order to feel protected right so in that instance what would stabilization look like yeah well stabilization in that instance I think looks like The Power of Choice yeah I can choose when I want to get use my anger to set a boundary to say no to establish safety for myself right because sometimes we do need a fight response like in this world that's a beautiful thing to have access to I always love it when my clients who've been maybe really dealing with functional freeze start to experience some of that rage and anger it's like ah the life force coming back right it it's such a beautiful thing and I I think particularly for young women and teenage girls they're they're often so shamed for their rage and anger and it's such a healthy of course it's important to you know anchor that right and again to be able to have choice and Consciousness around it like ooh is this really a threatening situation where I need to be ta into this huge amount of fight or actually this is somebody that loves me but I'm feeling disconnected unlovable you know unsafe in some way what is it that I need right that what are those underlying needs so I think being able to stay in connection with another human being being able to stay in connection with yourself and have access to choice I really think that's that's such a big part of stabilization and just even being able to recognize stay within one's window of tolerance like ooh I'm starting to feel angry can I stay in my body can I take a breath right can I turn the volume down on this anger like these are all emotional regulation skills that that basic Foundation of stabilization that's often really not accessible to a lot of nervous systems and we can carry so much shame just like just like you named there right I used to have blackout rage episodes you know where I just lost myself I lost lost connection to my true nature my sense of self presence and was just acting out in that anger so you know and and then we begin to even in our own trauma response disconnect from a sense of self trust yes right that that's really such a the heart and soul of I think a lot of complex PTSD is and and just PTSD even in general over time as we live with it as the sense of like my own nervous system has become the source of that sense of threat and you know almost like an enemy inside of myself yes yes thank you for saying that and talking about your experience of trauma I know for me that one of the only things in my life I can truly say that I have regret about is the places where my trauma hurt the people that I love I know that kind of anger response was one of the most predominant in terms terms of hurting my friends early on when I was younger like in my 20s and really hurting my partners right like my one wish was always like I wish I could have loved people better and it had nothing to do with my heart and everything to do with how much I was willing to do the work to be able to heal those patterns that were making me behave that way but I did I had tremendous shame and I was like how can I be such a spiritual person how can I have done so much work and still this part of me would come out and I love saying that for everyone listening because we're like these two nice professional ladies who work to help people you know and like both of us have had this experience of anger and rage which is so shamed in society like even saying that right now I'm like oh like you know are people gonna think I'm going to yell at them are people gonna think like I'm you know can't hold a professional space as a teacher things like that and you know I I will also say that I was able to hold a deep and clear professional space uh far better than I was able to hold that same space in my most intimate relationships oh absolutely and it's still my learning curve to be able to inhabit the depth of clarity and love and compassion that I can hold as a teacher with the people I love the most and that's like my lifetimes work basically and I will say because I I'll tease a little bit of what we're going to talk about when I did you know more traditional therapy I found that while I was being taught to stabilize myself right like notice when I'm starting to get anger like starting to feel anger starting to get angry to slow everything down to hold myself to uh you know take some deep breaths all of that something felt missing in that Journey because I would start to feel the oncoming anger and then it would almost just be like it would like go down the slide I'm be like oh my God like here we go like hid's alive you know of jaal and hide like you know I just feel like I'm on this like anger slip and slide and I like can't get off it you know and so even though I knew what to do there was something missing in my own relationship to my energy and my nervous system where it was like I know what to do and somehow like I can't seem to do it yes oh 100% I I think to me that's like the gift of having done my own internal work inside myself and my personal relationships that gives gives me so much trust in the emotions that often feel so scary in my clients because I to me anger is the same energy as passion and when we can really there's something very wrong that I always felt when I was constantly turning down the dial on my anger it made my life way more functional yeah you know it was very very necessary and and I was in huge cycles of self- sabotage like almost fatal eating disorder like really a lot of what I would call retroflex of aggression like all this unexpressed rage that I was just turning against myself constantly right and so being able to feel that and start to you know turn down the dial emotionally regulate was was huge it allowed me to actually live a life that was worth living as opposed to walking around you know kind of wishing not just kind of like wishing that I could just leave this lifetime and yet when I started to actually be able to have the capacity to meet my anger with love all of these like really important unmet needs all of this truth just started pouring out of me all of this passion truly that I had never that I knew was there but never been able to access all of a sudden was accessible to me I mean it changed my career it changed my entire life and even just now talking about it like I have such a deep embodied Trust of the source of our pain that it is it is the portal you know that it that it does hold the keys to the deeper truths the like truest purpose that the soul has for us on this planet and you know I mean anger is just one we could walk down all the emotional you know sliping sides I'm excited to take a moment and share with you about the vaita coaching certification this program has been around for almost 10 years and it is my highest offering the sexual Wellness industry is forecast to be $125 billion industry by

only your own life but the life of so many others around the world you can get on the weight list now at Leila Martin VA weight list I would love to walk down some of the other slip and sides and I I think kind of I I had a the similar experience that I want to articulate which is there's this small subset of people in the healing Realms in the psychotherapeutic Realms and the medical Realms and the spiritual Realms that are like really interested in human Liberation and wholeness and vitality and health right I won't take that away from existing in any profession and for the longest time the psychotherapeutic model which really intersects with the medical model in the United States was all about normalizing people so that they could function in a pretty broken capitalist system right and so the to me the gift of regulating our anger right and learning to tone it down when our behaviors are too much right there's a value in that in terms of being able to hold oneself being able to Center oneself being able to have the power of choice in oneself and there's like this shadow in that which I hear you alluding to which is for you know the last few hundred years in Western Society it's like we need you to tone it down so you don't cause any problems and you can like get your factory job done right or get your N9 to5 done and so there is this like hidden little sneaky part of that where they like we're just teaching everyone to be safe and you're like yeah and there's a huge Sovereign expression of the power of a person inside that we haven't always honored in these models we haven't always known how to as a society I think it's actually quite threatening yeah to the status quo yes you know and for me personally I never you know safety is such a like buzzword in the trauma world it's very necessary I think it also doesn't make sense to a lot of people but I think the reason at least for me personally the reason why safety never really landed until I started to do more Liber Liberation work is because I personally think power is a precursor to safety no if if you think about like a safe nervous system to me I I always think of I have this one cat that loves to just like like lay on her back like let her legs sprawl out and she's just belly up you know tail laying on the ground that that to me is like the epitome of of a safe nervous system it's open it's in this you know Supine position that's just so vulnerable to the world and how can we ask someone to experience safety in their nervous system if they don't have never had the experience of being able to effectively you know protect themsel yeah have that level of power to say no and add on top of that maybe they carry diagnosis around their anger even from childhood right that's one of the most I mean there's a whole set of very common diagnoses for children that are all around like you know Oppositional Defiant Disorder conduct disorder it's like your anger is pathologized and and then they grow up and it's like oh you're traumatized maybe now we recognize that you're traumatized and you need to feel safe but all along you've been taught that your anger is very threatening to everyone around you yes and so how can you actually enable your nervous system to be able to it does not make any sense to me how we go from traumatized to Safe without passing through strength and power you know the ability to stand on our own two feet and hold our own I definitely received that transmission culturally around anger right that it wasn't okay that it was bad that it was destructive right and this sense especially as a woman that I should never feel anger and then I started to observe a few things when I worked with people in my workshops in my healing spaces and you know Liberation practices and number one I saw that people experience anger as a natural expression when their boundaries are violated totally right so like when you encroach on my space I will feel angry if you try and hurt my child I will feel angry if you're causing Injustice to me or people I care about I will feel angry right like this protective mechanism is someone is trying to violate my boundary right violate my safety and so I will respond to that threat by expressing anger right it's a protective defense mechanism and so what I also saw was that when people felt so much shame around their anger when they started to heal their boundaries when they started to feel feel powerful again they would actually feel the suppressed Rage of having had their boundaries violated and in order to restore their boundaries they would actually have to go through a period of feeling angry right so if you've lived under any kind of boundary violation with a parent or a system of Injustice right it's like as I reclaimed my power I'll just use the example as a woman realizing how much the world had taken from me because I had a [\\xa0__\\xa0] there was a phase in which I was enraged at everyone right and what I realized was that when my boundaries were being violated over and over again when I was young I silenced the rage eventually and just gave up and just sort of went silent and went into freeze so as I healed the freeze and woke up my power again the rage came back yeah now if I don't let myself feel that rage I will just collapse back into the freeze if I let self experience the rage I feel like the boundary returns and the power returns so to me anger and power are very connected I would also see as I would work with women's bodies right like we've both been in breath work spaces that when a woman for instance would be just sobbing and sobbing and going into collapse over and over again her just touching her sadness over and over again never created the kind of alchemical transformation it wasn't until we would encourage her to start kicking to start punching to start like reclaiming the power expression of her body that she would then resolve this kind of collapse into sadness that exactly as you just said this like feeling the power of her body allowed her to move out of the trauma response into sadness over and over again or into this collapse over and over again or into this freeze so anger is so complex in that if you received a lot of unintegrated Anger from anyone it is toxic it is painful one of the reasons I was such an [\\xa0__\\xa0] was because people were [\\xa0__\\xa0] to me right and let me just say that the [\\xa0__\\xa0] is a temple to God and I think it's actually a very sacred part of the human body I feel a little bad just using the word and like you get the idea so in that it was like okay their anger was toxic but anything in life can be medicine or poison right and so instead of just making anger poison how do you make it medicine and the way that you relate to it in the way that you experience it and ultimately you know one of the things that healed me was being able to have an anger gasm like literally being able to orgasm with the energy of my anger it so revolutionized my relationship to this emotion yes absolutely and I think that for me personally when I did your program of vaa coaching that was that was the biggest piece the emotional Liberation and being able to be in these sticky icky emotions like the first time I had a shame gasm was one of the most spiritual experiences I've I've ever had yeah you know it was like whoa this is shame yeah like this is my shame yeah you know and and to me it changed everything it changed the way that I saw my clients it changed the way that I saw my children it changed the way that I saw my relationship because I mean really in that moment I and and it really was shame because that that particular emotion was so hard for me to stomach and being able to experience the height of pleasure and this expansive awe and love and gratitude in the very experience of Shame itself was so incredibly liberating and it it taught me that yes it's not just about feeling the feeling right we can go and do cathartic practices we can you know have all kinds of management strategies I I really think like the the crying Loop that you're talking about that happens that's such a common emotional management strategy it's like I often describe it to my clients like letting the steam off you know a pot of boiling water it takes the pressure off but it doesn't change the pattern at all so it's one of the things that's so beautiful about working with another human being or like being in a group space where there are facilitators that can catch you when you're clearly looping in your own pattern is to kind of like what would happen if you just slowly started to resist the urge to cry right now I bet you a 100 bucks you start to get angry you might get angry at me because I'm asking you to pause and hold back on the tears a little bit but it's like the new pattern starts to emerge the energy can flow in a new Direction and as it does I think just the experience of newness gives us more space to be curious about it to be able to bring more presence to it playfulness these are all elements of you know our safety system yeah but ultimately I think that love is the superpower like our Vita principle number one that love bringing love to these emotions is the great alchemizer yes absolutely so and just for anyone listening in Anger gasm it's like I am turning myself on I am moving towards an orgasmic state or a pleasure State and I'm also allowing the emotion and experience of anger to flow through me so as I'm moving into orgasmic state I'm also experiencing the simultaneous um flow of anger within me and that's how you get an anger gasm so it be the same with a sham gasm right I am moving into the state of orgasm and I'm experiencing shame alongside it so I have a shame gasm and these are practices like you're actually taught how to do that how to relate to the emotion with love how to bring the emotion into your body while you're feeling pleasure and then ultimately how to orgasm with the emotion right which what it does for for me psychologically is it makes me not only unafraid of the experience of these emotions but radically repattern how I experience them because if I can have an orgasm with my shame I don't have to run scared of my shame anymore exactly which is a hidden way of becoming present with it right and so this kind of Loops into you said like one of the things that you're super passionate about is emotional Liberation I'd love to hear more about that and one of the things that I experienced was when I was just trying to feel the moment that I started to get angry and to like contain it I couldn't do that very effectively once I started ritualizing my anger meaning like I create a safe ritual space where I can hit a pillow throw a tantrum cry and scream and then I actually have anger gasms when I started to then feel my nervous system becoming angry it was like oh like I can play with this right like I can actually make my anger art or I can make Aros out of my anger that did more for my ability to not be angry with people than just trying to contain my anger absolutely and I would actually argue that a ritual space is a containment practice right it's contained there's a beginning middle and end so we are able when we create that kind of I I almost want to call it an external container right it's that intentional time and space we we allow ourselves a little bit more space to explore because it's not going to last forever you know it's like I'm here I have an intention but the interesting thing about that when you were sharing is my my shame gasm was not it did not happen in the context of a ritual space we could say that I created it for myself but I was just on a Sunday afternoon jog by myself on my property in the middle of the woods and I it was like I you know often when I'm when I'm jogging on the trails at my place you'll like run into um a spider web which is such an un uh not nice experience but it was like that it was like I just ran into this web of Shame and I just felt it so viscerally and I stopped and and I just felt the trees like I mean I was in the middle of your program so I was doing daily practices um around this but I just felt the like portal open and I and my body just began to respond I'm you know I started to breathe with the shame I started to like ground and feel the Earth beneath me I think I got down on all fours and I just surrendered to the shame I just took over it wasn't like I was in a self-pleasure practice although it was wildly orgasmic I wasn't even touching myself I'm I'm an extremely energetic um you know erotic human being and so so emotion as energy comes pretty intensely um and naturally to me but it was such a profound experience and I remember afterwards just like laying in the grass which I'm completely allergic to I was like oh this is going to be bad but it felt so good and smelling the Earth and just feeling this sense of like wholeness and Oneness that to me was only given to me through the shame itself you know and I and there was a choice right like when it first when I first like ran through that web and hit hit the shame I noticed all of the old stories of like what did I do wrong right it wants my my shame wants to attach to a story was it something that I said that class that I taught was it you know the way that I handled that client situation oh my goodness am I just completely failing my children that's usually one place that my shame likes to go I've never met a mother who doesn't go there um you know but I I just maybe because I had been jogging I don't know I I just had the the power of Choice probably in large part because of your transmission to to let go of those stories and to just be in my body and yeah it was truly life-changing wow I'm going to be super real with you I realized that the number one thing I want in my life is to feel good right an amazingly happy life is built on feeling good inside of the nervous system those are some of the most challenging feeling states to achieve when we're being bombarded Ed by femails and screen time and overwhelming to-do lists and career and family pressures and to reset the nervous system to be in its natural state of pleasure and play that's right nature actually wanted us to feel pleasurable playful sensual it takes work research has shown it can take up to two hours to switch from go mode to deep relaxation where you want to connect and feel good if you're like me and you don't have 2 hours at the end of the day to meditate to do yoga then supplements and plants can actually help your nervous system to feel the ways that you crave if you're interested in

shame is something like a natural response to the threat of disconnection okay yeah I'd love to talk about that for a minute uh in terms of one of my relational trauma bodies that I've really been tracking is if I go deep enough into like it's almost like a sadness Loop but deep down inside it's like I feel like my partner is mad at me for doing something and I know that a big part of that can be my projection onto him he's like I might be frustrated or angry but I'm like not mad at you in this thing and I will feel this like overwhelming amount of Shame and almost like I'm sorry like I'm just like so sorry that my being is like wrong somehow that my being is unlovable that my being did something wrong and there's like this deep it's like it's like this ball of Shame that's like so intense and what I Marvel at is you know I have this phrase that I use in the Vita program which is like I eat shame for breakfast and in my own experience I have gotten to a place where shame can actually be like a pleasant experience or like a all right like let me have a shame gasm or let me just like Let It move through my body right so if we're talking not inter relationally if I feel shame over my body if I feel shame over like how I look if I feel shame that I did something like didn't pay enough attention or whatever I can actually let that emotion just flow through my system and be like okay okay okay right and then it passes because I let it actually move through my system I'm present with it I hold it with love and in a way this allows for the energy body to digest the shame right so that's actually why I use the phrase I eat shame for breakfast because this ability to digest emotions is in my experience a tantric concept that when you have a strong enough and open enough energy body you can actually digest your life experience including your emotions so instead of walking around being like I can't feel this I can't feel this no it's not okay to feel this it's like oh I can feel this and my energy system is strong enough to handle it to digest it to not collapse into it or go into a huge you know trying to now compensate because I don't want to feel this shame externally I could just be with my life and be with my emotions right that's where I feel like the real emotional Power Center is and what I'm really noticing as we're having this conversation is like wow in relationship to my partner when I sink into this shame ball I haven't gotten to the place where I can eat shame for breakfast inter relationally I'm just like I'm so sorry that I'm like a cosmic [\\xa0__\\xa0] up and I'm like where did Leila go right cuz I'm like pretty empowered in my life now I'm pretty expressed I'm pretty Shameless it's not that I don't have shame sometimes I look at myself like you know when I've gotten ready for a podcast maybe I did my makeup really fast or I didn't brush my hair enough and I'll still have this like oh I'm like a Colorado girl who was like raised lazy or you know like I like I don't know how to like like I'm like messing up my hair as I speak about this like I don't know how to look so polished and glamorous right which is like a real story I had about like New York girls growing up like they're all so like glamorous and put together and I'm like this strange Midwestern kid who's like always got food spilled on me and like something's unut button and like my my pants are on backwards more than you would think any human could manage to put their pants or shirt on backwards like the number of times where people are like is is your sweater on inside out and I'm like sure is right so I would say now I've like gotten to a place where I'm 80% Shameless about those things that used to just like give me so much shame and there's still like 20% that'll crop in sometimes but like it's pretty balanced relationally oh my God that shame ball I just I feel like it like gets like overwhelms me and it's very hard to come back and so I'm just kind of feeling this like okay there's this next layer relationally I felt that with anger as well I stopped being angry professionally with my friends as a you know matter of course I had to really like commit to like I will not become angry with customer service people like I just won't do it right and for the longest time I was really good and then I had one call with the Chase Bank and it was just and I was like oh okay we failed we have to reset we have to reset and never like horrible like I'm not horrible to a customer service person I'm just like I lose the like I get a little bit like Angry you can feel that I'm angry or frustrated whereas like my process and my invitation has been what it would it be to stay in your heart to communicate clearly to not go into anger and the relational anger took me years of practice and work and I almost had to see these like operating layers of my ego like real illusionary stories I was telling myself like if you let this person get away with this you're going to have to break up right or like if you if this keeps happening you won't love them anymore so it's like I was going into existential threat and justifying my anger I had to walk myself back from that right now I'm really seeing like I I feel that this relational shame ball that I can go into I want to learn to meet it in a different way and actually the thing that's coming to me is like what would it look like in those relational exchanges actually pause and ritualize my shame right then right to pause and literally maybe even have a shame gasm in that moment and change the interational experience of my own shame yeah I think I think it is so amazing to be able to to me having being able to have that choice of like oo right now I feel so much shame and I I also can really relate to what you're talking about in my primary partnership right of this like this huge threat of disconnection that brings this massive ball of shame that for me often feels like I I can't talk like the more that I speak the more disconnection is going to happen that's that's sort of my narrative it's like just shut the f up Corey like you know and it's so toxic and so being able to like meet that shame as an energy ha have a ritual is beautiful and I also think that there's some really important information that's probably underneath that like we don't do this work and then we no longer experience anger we no longer experience shame right they're they're such important I like to think of all emotions as like Messengers from our soul yeah you know and and so to me when I experience something like a shame spiral like that in my partnership it's really helpful for me to ask myself where am I experiencing disconnection you know like what are the parts of me maybe that are coming up right now that don't feel safe and seen by my partner that don't feel like like even though I've been with them for two decades like they don't they don't have a place here they don't feel like they have a place here yeah and and so like that also like that piece to me needs to be there to really like particularly in an intimate partnership where you are like cultivating intimate you know self-discovery connection right there's it's such a ripe like petri dish for shame to start to pop out when we get intimate the shame starts to come out and if we don't want to feel it it's way easier to feel angry at my partner you know it's much easier to maybe even feel anxiety and just kind of go shut down and go inward but to be willing to feel the shame I think you know that's like always my first step is like thank you thank you to me for being willing to sh to feel it thank you to my soul for being willing to like offer me this opportunity and then yeah like can I bring pleasure and love to this but can I also listen you know for for where are these new places of disconnection that are just like popping up so that we can create more intimacy more connection right so let's pause right there and actually just hear from you what is the journey that you went on that caused you to understand that trauma healing was so important and then that there's this next level of trauma healing that we're not always yet talking about sure well my journey is such a it's it's such a blended Journey it it really started as my personal Journey when I was about 20 years old I was really deep deep in my trauma response actively suicidal so I started my healing Journey at that point I mean I just hit rock bottom I'd been in therapy but you know and I'd actually been practicing yoga and meditation but really coming at all of that from a very anorexic standpoint I wanted to control myself because I felt so out of control from all the trauma so as I began to recognize you know just over like falling on my face over and over again like okay this control method is really not working it's actually making me really really sick I started to simultaneously study human psychology and social work particularly um and became very interested in using my mind which was such a source of suffering for me to try to understand and make sense of what was going on with me so my my career path and my personal Journey have always been really entwined in that way and from the very beginning I was really interested in child de development and and particularly attachment and later on I realize now that I was really trying to tell the story of attachment trauma although you know when I was in graduate school in the early 2000s like that wasn't at least a part of what I was really you know I mean we were talking about attachment Styles and you know how to create secure attachment but there wasn't a lot in the literature about developmental trauma at that point but it was really resonating for me like just being with babies and moms uh something was really waking up inside of me and and so I started to come to my own personal practice and healing work continuing to engage with yoga and meditation and breath work the body has always been such an important portal for me I think on the one hand because I'm an eating disorder Survivor and you know blessed with recovery so the body has been such a source of pain and shame um and and honestly Terror and then at the same time like I knew that I needed to heal with my body so I'm trying to answer your question here as I began to study and then work with people more and more I it just became so clear in my own system that we were all dealing with trauma that at the end of the day you know all of my Psychopathology you know study just maybe really just about trauma yeah and that that really came to light with my within my own system um and and that there was something for me there was something intangible like all the shock trauma I could tell horrendous stories you know of sexual assault and and different experiences that I had but it never actually touched those stories never touched the pain that I carried they couldn't quite it was like I was going to therapy and trying to come up with like what are the stories for my therapist that can help them to understand how much existential shame rage Terror you know just like fear of complete fragmentation uh really big pieces of pain I would was carrying and you know I would tell these stories and then I would be met with often oh but you know the like positive reframe and it was like just doing exactly the opposite of what I needed which was validation and connection in those moments and somebody looking at me and feeling the story but looking at the pain that was underneath it saying I see you this pain is valid you know you carry pain from your lifetime yes and these stories but also so much much more yeah you know the those early years and even your your inherited trauma right there's such a bigger story that that we can start to understand when we open our ears and our hearts and our minds to to the story that the body is really telling us that's so much more than just what happened who said what um so so all of that really led me into okay we have to be able to work with the body and we need to be able to tap into that pain that doesn't necessarily make sense that doesn't have you know the the story that's easy to kind of tell from beginning middle and end to touch on that something I've really felt with most humans is like they have a hard time progressing to True healing until someone hears yeah how much pain they're in and it's just like I see you yeah like it's okay to be in that much pain and given your infinite intelligence everything you've been through this lifetime past lifetimes who even knows the fracture of our tribal systems the Brokenness of our way of being with the Earth with our families with our bodies spiritual you know dissociation and disconnection and really hard teachings that make us kind of hate ourselves like of course you're in that much pain right like I feel you in that yes and I think sometimes people can go their whole lives and never get that it's interesting to me is I find sometimes that one piece is an obstructing factor to them being able to then go okay now I want to start digesting it and move forward you know and like sometimes I see that with these like oh let's change the belief system like let's look at it positively let's find the silver lining what's the gift in it you know it's like if that comes before someone is just fully seen in the depth of their pain I find that actually like it doesn't land right it's that I see you first the being Fon and exactly as you you discussed so from your uh Psychotherapy training right and and you do at our Retreats this this great service right of really inviting people back into sovereignty if they are getting stuck in a trauma spiral right you're excellent at taking people who have gotten very fragmented or very deep in some sort of spiral mental emotional where they're no longer able to be in their sovereignty you're you're so good at bringing them out of that and back into their pow it's one of your superpowers and something that's so interesting that you've said is like all of that training took me so far and then I started to see something else when I started to engage in more of the tantric practices more of the somatic practices more of the emotional Liberation techniques what is it that you saw and learned that showed you like wow something might be missing and when people get this piece they actually start to heal even more deeply I think it's interesting what you just said about needing to be seen in our pain yeah and to me emotional Liberation is about being able to see oneself in the pain and and when we say see we really mean like I I can feel you right it's the it's the feeling with another person and I I think it's such an important experience you know for those who are listening to this when you're looking for a trauma you know therapist or space holder to heal with it's the most important component is that you feel felt yeah by the person that's holding that space and then in turn what happens is we begin to be able to feel that and relate to that within ourself to see and feel our own pain and to be able to you know yes bring safety to it but to me safety is also like honor you know true true safety is like full acceptance allowing this to be here that is when we have the space to bring safety to our rage to our shame you know to both see it and allow it fully and that's a hard thing to do it's easy to talk about it's way different to actually experience it it's why I think it's so helpful to not try to do the trauma healing alone because we have a million of those emotional management strategies to not feel it right how can I let off just enough steam that I can kind of shove this back to the into the closet yeah so to speak and so that you know when we're on retreat with participants that's really all I'm doing I mean all I'm doing it's it's a big job but it's feeling the pain with someone and bringing love and safety and a hell yes like you can handle this this is yours this is your Birthright and that for me was was the piece that that I think really shifted me out of you know the stabilization medical model of like okay where are the symptoms how can we decrease you know the level of um yeah dysfunction here so that we can create a more stabilized system it was like I think that these symptoms might be goddess Consciousness itself you know and and not not to say that it doesn't need stabilization but it really changes the way that we relate to those emotions that feel so painful when we start to recognize that they are our power they are our life force that there's so much truth here um and and maybe even they're showing up just at the right time you know when I have just just enough capacity to be able to handle it just enough support I think that's really um I'll just say this one last thing but I think that that's also why in Intimate relationship we do feel the deepest levels of Shame of unsafety you know um of disregulation because there is that container that's safe enough for these old deep places of vulnerability and pain to start to surface yeah absolutely and I think the way that I see what you're discussing is like this containment right it's like there's times when I start going into a story start feeling overwhelming emotions and it's like all right Leela pack it in yeah like like take a few deep breaths calm yourself down go for a little walk get yourself out of it because it's time to work it's time to show up for the people you love it's time to take a flight somewhere like you don't have time for some sort of emotional Deep dive right now so holding it down in myself sometimes of like let's not go there let's relax our nervous system let's ground and let's just go into a sense of safety a sense of calm a safety of presence right that's such a beautiful skill everyone needs that skill absolutely and if that's the only skill you have it can engender a kind of fragility because if you're not able to contain right or if all you can do is contain feeling yourself still feels terrifying right feeling your own anger what you've been alluding to feeling your own rage feeling your own fear feeling your own vastness of love right feeling your own erotic charge can still feel so scary if all you're being taught is contain contain contain right if all you're being taught is you know find a sense of safety that's just about Comfort right and I think what you're endeavoring to teach people and and a lot of the work we do together is what does it look like to be able to be with all of yourself and feel safe to be able to be with the vastness of your shame or your anger or your fear or your turn on or your love and to feel present and loving and express and safe in all that you are and I think what we're longing for is someone to meet us there inter relationally so that we can start to map that territory in ourselves right that's what I ultimately want for people is not to have to control their inner reality but to be able to meet their inner reality and part of the empowerment of that is the only part of us in my experience that can truly meet ourselves at that level of love is our Consciousness it is our presence so when you're being taught that you're being taught not to control your reality from your mind which can be useful at times but to literally learn to be with yourself and meet yourself from the expansive presence that's within all of us once I found that piece I was like oh there's I'm not afraid to step into a ceremony a ritual a love making session you know falling in love all of that a deep relationship because I know that I can meet myself and I'm constantly finding the edges where I still can't meet myself or where it overwhelms me or where I do get terrified but I actually trust that I can find my way back to presence with myself and to me when you say like I feel like emotional Liberation is such a huge key right that that is this whole next step for people to be like oh I can actually be good with all of myself yes yes and I think the presence piece is so important and actually quite complex yeah because when we're in those big emotional triggers there's we're often so much experiencing the patterns from the past and then often you know catastrophizing the imagined future and we're not in the present and that then just feeling is what leads to more disregulation and we cause harm to ourself or others yeah but when we can actually be present which I think containment you know know when I was first studying EMDR therapy there's such a beautiful containment process that um I I think every single kindergartener like across the planet should learn yeah and I teach it in in the trauma workshops that I teach for vaita coaching which is it's so simple it's just an imaginary container you know and you notice like what doesn't feel good and what are the memories right the thoughts the images that come to mind with that and can you place it in the container and put the lid on top right it's it's so simple and it's I mean it's almost like oh come on but I think it's important to to Really differentiate that that that practice is very different than repression we're not just stuffing it down we're actually acknowledging oo there's painful stuff from the past but that past is not happening right now yeah know and and for the nervous system like we don't know like our our internal biology does not necessarily know the difference between imagined and real threat right we Neuroscience has really shown that that is true it's why visualization in preparing for a performance is so helpful because for the nervous system we're going over those patterns and it feels like we're doing the thing it's the same as when we go into the past and we rehash that it feels like it's happening right now for my body even though a part of my psyche might know that it's not and so being able to like externalize that experience put it away and then maybe meet the emotion in the now yeah you know that's left over yeah and having again like that choice that's that's that first piece of stabilization right I'm going to choose to put this away I'm not going to feel this right now I want to have a nice breakfast with my partner I don't actually want to like process all my existential shame with him this moment toally totally guess just want to enjoy this grapefruit and like have a good laugh you know what a great empowerment tool to be able to put it away but then it still needs to maybe be dealt with you know and so when is a good time when we can both say okay let's pick a time and a place to actually work on this you know box back out let's get that box out and and let's start to make love to it you know and and maybe the memories aren't even necessary so much I mean I think that's really where therapy um and specific trauma you know focused treatments can be so helpful yeah but once we've worked on the charge around that past stuff we still need to meet these emotions inside oursel as a human being and that presence piece is is so incredibly key um because all of a sudden it becomes more manageable when it's just the here and now yes you know and I don't have to actually like process generations of trauma you know like I can but I could also like invoke my ancestors to hold space for me and I could be like you know feeling feeling that sense of Honor in being able to feel this in the here and now it just makes it so much more digestible I think in that way yes so okay so a containment practice would be okay I'm sitting here I'm doing something and like a trigger comes up a feeling of Rage a feeling of wanting to control something a feeling of sadness feeling shame I'm like okay right now not the time to feel this right like I I need to be doing something else you could be coaching right you could be holding space for a client I might need to go to work might be like look I'm I'm just I don't need to do this right now like you're saying I'm I'm having breakfast with my partner I'd rather enjoy my grapefruit right then they like drag back to the past so I feel there's a box of some sort right mine is like gold has like gold um sides and like clear glass and I'm just going to put it in there I'm going to put the lid on it and I'm going to go back to what I was doing right so that would be a form of containment and as we said you know if you box everything away for too long and you never open it back up it's probably going to like start coming back in ways that like haunt you right so the Box technique is good for some parts of life where you want to just keep going uninterrupted what would a let's say in the the anger comes up the trigger comes up the shame comes up I'm eating my grapefruit what would a small emotional Liberation approach look like in that moment yeah I think that's such a great question uh so for me personally in that situation I'm going to feel my feet on the ground and my seat in the chair especially with anger I think it's so important to ground to ground that energy it's so fiery and I am generally speaking a fiery human being um you know so so it's important for me to connect to the ground and to take some breath with it right to to come back into my body because even though I've done so much work with emotion like this is these are the always the foundational first steps is breath body ground know I can't really liberate anything if I'm not in my body and then I might just feel it for a moment you know let myself maybe sound the sensation of anger and it doesn't need to be you know it could just be hum on exhale but it's like feeling like a low growl through my chest yeah you know and then I'm gonna like take a moment to to check in with myself does it feel okay to be here like you said earlier right anger is that emotion of like letting me know that there's a boundary here there's a boundary breach there's some some significant unmet need typically like around um the amount of space so do I need to back up a little bit even let my chair just move back away from the table for a moment and as I am with that and I'm listening to it I'm I'm really listening to what are these unmet needs like how to me my practice if it's anger I'm looking for the passion what is it that I really want what am I lit up about in this that's getting missed and coming out as anger if it's shame that I experience in that moment I this is a game that I play to me shame is the same energy is actually healthy shining Pride like when my shame is liberated I feel like like the kind of innocent Pride that you see in toddlers it's there's no ego there right it's like I can unload all of this food from my chair onto the floor look at what my hands can do you know that kind of effusive sense of like shining Pride so so I hold that actually in my mind like this is the potential of this energy right if it's fear then to me it's like ooh there's something new there's Adventure there's like in the attachment literature we often call it seeking it's that Curiosity and again toddlers are such a great example of this if they're afraid they're like clinging to their caregiver right when they when that energy is liberated they're like wandering out into the street right they're just seeking new new and new adventure so I to me I hold that you know in my conscious awareness is that there is a potential for the full spectrum of this emotion and can I bring love and safety so maybe I do give voice to it to my partner maybe I start to talk about it maybe I just allow myself to feel it and enjoy it and let it be just for me these are all you know different ways that we can start to meet it but that that presence in peace and getting out of it really is a discipline to not get stuck on while he's chewing with the mouth open you know and it's driving me nuts well like I can address that in the moment but there's so much energy that comes up in that experience that's so rich that could create you know a spontaneous like fun morning sex scene right like that there's so much potential and yet we tend to stay kind of rigidly clamped down either holding our judgments or our stories like you know right in our face or or we're just like okay I got to put that away yeah right and so it's like can I feel it and can I trust it to me that those are like the two the two components of emotional Liberation is can I trust the wisdom of this emotion and then start to have choice of how I can play with it myself and maybe with another person and I think the invitation of that is to learn to play with your emotional experiences is to learn to play with life and to me that is the ultimate sign of having integrated or healed our trauma is that we're able to play where before we got stuck or angry or sad or Frozen yes oh my goodness yes and I feel like I play in my work now more than I mean it's such a playful place like it's funny that I call it work right um but it is it's it's the embodiment of play like that is how I approach trauma healing and Liberation is is the space of play and our mind becomes this actually incredible tool that we can use to play pretend with that you know because I think in the sematic world often the mind gets like a bad rep like we're supposed to not not be in story or not you know stay out of the mind and it's like the mind the imagination is one of the pieces that we get to reclaim in this process and to be able to Envision just you know around the breakfast table there like what might be possible if I meet this moment of petty anger with a little bit more curiosity and embodiment and pleasure and openness so much magic can come absolutely yes so where can people find you and work with you my website is probably the easiest way to get in touch with me um Cornelia scott.com and right now I'm really fully booked but I'm happy happy for people to join my mailing list I'm happy um to be in touch I love hearing from people who are interested in my work um I'll open my waiting list at some point soon so if you really feel a burning desire feel free to reach out um but yeah that those are probably the best the best places I I'm a working mom I love my clients and so for this season in my life like I'm not active on social media I don't have big platforms I'm I'm really just loving my life and loving my clients and loving the work that we're getting to do and that's that's really that's really where I I tend to like kind of Nest myself at least in this season so it's a it's a narrow it's a narrow path to get to me but I also love to hear from people and another way that people can work with you is by joining VA coaching you one of our senior teachers and would you take a moment just to share with people what is so amazing about the program as someone with a full weight list and roster of clients why are you part of our program why do you teach in it I love the vaita coaching program so much Leila it's so good uh What I love the most about it is the way that you can use V coaching in so many different capacities right we have alumni who are business coaches who are teachers who are attorneys it's like I I mean it and yet the work itself I I hear stories on The Daily of how that program has influenced their work their life you know their relationships and to me that that also is the piece of V coaching that makes it so profound is is I think the focus on relationship you know and and gaining coaching skills is something that I think every working professional could really use because all almost all of our work even if we work totally on our own we still have a relationship with ourself and a relationship with our own work that we need to be able to be you know curious about and in conscious partnership with and and to me that that's such a huge part of the program is how how are we relating to our s how are we relating to the momentto moment impulses that are coming up the desires that we have you know the people in our life the people from our past and then what do we do with that how are we creating this new this New Path forward um I also think that V coaching the way that you've created it where you get to do this deep internal dive inside your own system and really explore your sexuality as a pathway to Liberation this is massive for so many people and and what a beautiful unique opportunity to get such a deep dive such a like it's so it's laid out in such a beautiful clear path through all of those 12 modules and then at the end of that get to move into really learning how to hold space for others experiencing other people holding space for oneself there's so much learning that I personally even though I had been a psychotherapist I'd been a certified EMDR therapist at that point like I had so many Tools in my tool box and when I signed up for Vita coaching I it was completely on a whim I did not have a good I don't know attitude toward the coaching industry in general I never thought I would be a coach it was purely for my own Tantra studies and curiosity I really thought I would just do trimester one and then quit we got you and then I was like oh [\\xa0__\\xa0] trimester 1 was mindblowing I guess I'll just show up to trimester 2 and then I completely fell in love with the coaching methodology and I started to just like sprinkle it into my therapy practice um almost immediately which I would tell most of my students t t don't do that um but I did and I and I had clients that I had worked with for many years who started to say things like I had no idea that my body could do that wow um I I remember after a session a client of mine laid down in the grass like in the parking lot like a little green space and I was like oh dear and and and in their next session it was like I've never experienced anything like that I felt like I had a psychedelic experience and it was just my own body yeah you know the freedom to be able to like walk into a therapy session when you've had incredible amounts of anxiety for your entire life and felt so unsafe to feel the safety of being able to just like lay down in the grass and look at the clouds before you drive home because you're in such an ecstatic State it's like such a precious gift right yes um and so I started to really I mean it was my clients and my own lived experience that that just said to me you you have to continue to do this yeah um yeah and and so I think that's what I want for everyone else I want I want other people with with other backgrounds right I I really think I I would like to stress that I think Bea coaching is for more than just people who want to be coaches or who are psychotherapists I really think it is for the leaders of our world to know how to hear another human being to know how to hear themsel and and create space for the body for the this for our sexual being yeah to come to

They also mention the importance of setting boundaries, using anger to establish safety, and choosing when to use anger to protect oneself. Additionally, they talk about the connection between anger and power, and how expressing anger can help restore boundaries and reclaim personal power. They also mention the concept of an \"anger gasm,\" which involves integrating the energy of anger into a pleasurable or orgasmic state.'"
